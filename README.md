# Retrofit
Retrofit is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. 

Retrofit developed by square and in documentation, it is type-safe REST client for Android and Java. Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.

Retrofit android is very simple to use. It essentially lets us treat API calls as simple Java method calls, so we only define which URLs to hit and the types of the request/response parameters as Java classes.

The entire network call + JSON/XML parsing is completely handled by Retrofit (e.g. Gson for JSON parsing). It allows to make a synchronous or asynchronous HTTP request to the remote webserver.
